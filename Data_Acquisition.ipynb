        "This notebook processes single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GSE300475 dataset to prepare it for downstream multimodal analysis. It covers downloading and extracting the raw data files, loading and annotating the gene expression matrix with patient and response metadata, and performing normalization, log-transformation, and selection of highly variable genes to reduce noise and focus on informative features. Key preprocessing steps are visualized, including gene variability and dimensionality reduction using PCA, both before and after filtering. Finally, the processed gene expression data is exported along with cell-level metadata to support integration with other data modalities and enable machine learning modeling of treatment response in breast cancer."
