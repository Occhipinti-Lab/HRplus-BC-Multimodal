# 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the file:

- `fluxomic_features.csv` — containing fluxomics-based features derived from Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA).

Each row corresponds to a sample (cell), and each column represents a reaction flux predicted by the metabolic model after preprocessing and constraint integration.
