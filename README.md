# Multiscale Flux Balance Analysis: Bridging Multi-Omics and Single-Cell Data for Therapy Response Prediction in Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer

This repository contains code and experiments for predicting treatment response in HR+ breast cancer using **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data**, **fluxomics features inferred with scFBApy**, and a **multimodal integration of both**. The project evaluates predictive performance when models are trained on **transcriptomics**, **fluxomics**, or on their **combined multimodal features**, in order to assess whether integration provides improved accuracy over single-modality approaches.

## About

This project provides a reproducible pipeline for prediction of breast cancer treatment response at the single-cell level. It includes data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning modeling, and explainability analyses.

**Key goals:**
- Evaluate predictive performance of transcriptomic and fluxomic features individually.
- Investigate the added value of multimodal integration.
- Provide a fully documented workflow for reproducibility and future extension.

**Notes:**
1. Notebook names are descriptive and numbered to indicate workflow order.  
2. `results/` stores experiment outputs, including plots. 
3. `data/` is generated by running the code for data acquisition.  
4. `requirements.txt` lists all Python dependencies for reproducibility.

## Experiments

### 01 â€“ Data Acquisition
- Loads raw scRNA-seq data from GEO.  
- Prepares cell-level metadata, patient IDs, and response labels.  
- Includes initial quality control and preprocessed matrices.

### 02 â€“ Flux Generation (scFBApy)
- Generates cell-level fluxes from scRNA-seq using `scFBApy`.    
- Outputs structured flux matrices for machine learning.

### 03 â€“ Transcriptomics
- Uses gene expression features for ML modeling.  
- Preprocessing: normalization, HVG selection, PCA.  
- Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN.  
- Includes SHAP-based explainability.

### 04 â€“ Fluxomics 
- Uses fluxomic features for ML modeling.  
- Evaluates predictive potential independently of transcriptomics.

### 05 â€“ Multimodal Integration
- Combines transcriptomics and fluxomics into a unified dataset.  
- Compares predictive performance of:
  1. Transcriptomics
  2. Fluxomics
  3. Multimodal concatenated features

## Data Source

The primary dataset comes from the **NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):**  

ðŸ”— [GSE300475 â€“ Single-cell RNA-seq of HR+ breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE300475)  

- Includes single-cell transcriptomes and TCR repertoire data across multiple patients.   
- Patient response status (Responder vs Non-responder) was mapped using the associated publication:  
  ðŸ”— [npj | Breast Cancer â€“ Dynamic single-cell systemic immune responses in immunotherapy-treated early-stage HR+ breast cancer patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-025-00776-1).  
- Processed into feature matrices for downstream analysis in this project.
