# Multiscale Flux Balance Analysis: Bridging Multi-Omics and Single-Cell Data for Therapy Response Prediction in Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer

This repository contains code and experiments for predicting treatment response in HR+ breast cancer using **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data**, **fluxomics features inferred with scFBApy**, and a **multimodal integration of both**. The project evaluates predictive performance when models are trained on **transcriptomics**, **fluxomics**, or on their **combined multimodal features**, in order to assess whether integration provides improved accuracy over single-modality approaches.

## About

This project provides a reproducible pipeline for prediction of breast cancer treatment response at the single-cell level. It includes data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning modeling, and explainability analyses.

**Key goals:**
- Evaluate predictive performance of transcriptomic and fluxomic features individually.
- Investigate the added value of multimodal integration.
- Provide a fully documented workflow for reproducibility and future extension.

## Data Source

The primary dataset comes from the **NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):**  

ðŸ”— [GSE300475 â€“ Single-cell RNA-seq of HR+ breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE300475)  

- Includes single-cell transcriptomes and TCR repertoire data across multiple patients.   
- Patient response status (Responder vs Non-responder) was mapped using the associated publication:  
  ðŸ”— [npj | Breast Cancer â€“ Dynamic single-cell systemic immune responses in immunotherapy-treated early-stage HR+ breast cancer patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-025-00776-1).  
- Processed into feature matrices for downstream analysis in this project.
