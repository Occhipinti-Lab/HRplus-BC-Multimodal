# Multiscale Flux Balance Analysis: Bridging Multi-Omics and Single-Cell Data for Therapy Response Prediction in Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer

This repository contains code and experiments for predicting treatment response in HR+ breast cancer using **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data**, **fluxomics features inferred with scFBApy**, and a **multimodal integration of both**. The project evaluates predictive performance when models are trained on **transcriptomics**, **fluxomics**, or on their **combined multimodal features**, in order to assess whether integration provides improved accuracy over single-modality approaches.

## About

This project provides a reproducible pipeline for prediction of breast cancer treatment response at the single-cell level. It includes data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning modeling, and explainability analyses.

**Key goals:**
- Evaluate predictive performance of transcriptomic and fluxomic features individually.
- Investigate the added value of multimodal integration.
- Provide a fully documented workflow for reproducibility and future extension.

## Notebooks

### 0_data_acquistion.ipynb
- Loads raw scRNA-seq data from GEO.  
- Prepares cell-level metadata, patient IDs, and response labels.  

### 1_preprocessing_genes.ipynb
- Performs quality control (QC): filters low-quality cells, removes outliers, and normalizes expression counts.
- Conducts Differential Expression (DE) analysis between responder and non-responder groups.
- Generates visualization plots including violin plots and gene expression distributions for QC validation.
- Saves the cleaned and preprocessed data for downstream flux generation.

### 2_generate_flux.ipynb
- Generates cell-level fluxes from scRNA-seq using `scFBApy`.    
- Outputs structured flux matrices for machine learning.

### 3_experiment_1.ipynb â€” Transcriptomic Features Only
- Uses **gene expression features** (HVGs) for ML modeling.  
- Models implemented: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN.  
- Hyperparameter tuning performed using **Optuna**.  
- Includes **SHAP contribution plots** for model interpretability.  
- Evaluates predictive performance based on transcriptomic data only.

### 3_experiment_2.ipynb â€” Fluxomic Features Only
- Uses **fluxomic features** (metabolic reactionâ€“based features).  
- Applies the same modeling and tuning pipeline as in Experiment 1.  
- Evaluates how well flux-based data alone can predict treatment response.  
- Includes feature importance visualization and SHAP explanations.

### 3_experiment_3.ipynb â€” Multimodal Integration (Transcriptomics and Fluxomics)
- Integrates **transcriptomic** and **fluxomic** features into a unified dataset  
  (based on top highly variable genes and corresponding fluxomic features).  
- Implements the same ML pipeline and models (Logistic Regression, RF, XGBoost, ANN).  
- Performs **Optuna** hyperparameter optimization and **SHAP** interpretation in multimodal mode.  
- Visualizes contribution plots comparing top features across both modalities.  

ðŸ“˜ *Each notebook is self-contained and can be executed independently for modality-specific or multimodal analysis.*

## Data Source

The primary dataset comes from the **NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):**  

ðŸ”— [GSE300475 â€“ Single-cell RNA-seq of HR+ breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE300475)  

- Includes single-cell transcriptomes and TCR repertoire data across multiple patients.   
- Patient response status (Responder vs Non-responder) was mapped using the associated publication:  
  ðŸ”— [npj | Breast Cancer â€“ Dynamic single-cell systemic immune responses in immunotherapy-treated early-stage HR+ breast cancer patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-025-00776-1).  
- Processed into feature matrices for downstream analysis in this project.
